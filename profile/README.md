# Building the infrastructure for autonomous multi-agent AI systems

Autobox-AI develops open-source tools and frameworks for orchestrating sophisticated multi-agent simulations where AI agents collaborate, negotiate, and solve complex problems autonomously. Our platform enables researchers and developers to design, deploy, and analyze AI agent interactions at scale.

## What We Do

We create production-ready infrastructure for multi-agent AI systems, focusing on:

- **Agent Orchestration**: Robust message-passing architecture for coordinating specialized AI agents through distributed queues
- **Simulation Management**: Full-stack platform for designing, running, and monitoring complex multi-agent scenarios
- **Real-time Analysis**: Comprehensive tracing, metrics, and visualization of agent behaviors and decision-making processes
- **Developer Experience**: Modern tooling with TypeScript/Node.js APIs, React frontends, and Python utilities for rapid prototyping

## Core Projects

Our modular architecture separates concerns across specialized repositories:

- **autobox-api**: High-performance backend orchestrating agent lifecycles and inter-agent communication
- **autobox-ui**: Intuitive web interface for simulation management and real-time monitoring
- **autobox-mocks**: Synthetic data generation for testing and development workflows
- **autobox-mocks-api**: Serverless mock endpoints for frontend development and integration testing
- **autobox-engine**: Multi-agent AI simulation engine to orchestrate and manage complex multi-agent scenarios in isolation

## Use Cases

Autobox enables practical applications in:

- Complex problem-solving through specialized agent collaboration
- Multi-stakeholder negotiation and consensus building
- Scenario exploration and strategic planning
- Research into emergent behaviors in multi-agent systems
